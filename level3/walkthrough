Starting the executable, it seems to get an entry from the terminal.
It doesn't seem to crash with differents strings.
We disassemble the executable and this time it reads the entry using "fgets()"
which isn't easily  exploitable. It also calls "printf()" and searching on internet
we found that printf is exploitable if used unproperly.

On this website (https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/), 
	we even found exactly how we could exploit the breach in our case :
		Overwritting a stack variable.

After some tries, we succeeded.

(python -c "print '\x8c\x98\x04\x08' + 'A'*41 + '%x%x%x%n'"; cat) | ./level3

Finally we have a shell with level4
