We disas the program with gdb and we check the fonction with info fun and we have a suspicious run fonction

We see the usage of "gets()" which isn't a safe function so we search the offset where we can overwrite EIP register.

So we found a buffer overflow at 76 to write the adress of the "run" fonction in EIP :

We use python to be able to write \x characters for the address of "run" to STDIN :

(python -c "print('A'*76 + '\x44\x84\x04\x08')"; cat) | ./level1

Finally we have a shell with level2
