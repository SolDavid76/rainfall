Testing './bonus1', we saw that we need to give an argument to the executable otherwise it crashes but the
program doesn't seems to print anything in stdout.

Using 'ltrace', we saw that in reality, it needs 2 arguments : 
		- the first one passed in 'atoi' so it's a number
		- the second one is passed in memcpy depending on the first one (len = first * 4).

We also found that the number cannot be bigger than '9'

In gdb, we found that there is an string comparison to 0x574f4c46 which is the ascii of "FLOW"
Starting At the 41st bit of the stack. 

But we cannot because our max 'memcpy' lenght is 36 chars (9 * 4) so we thought of giving a negative 
number to the atoi (which is lower than '10') and the '* 4'  operation will overflow it to a positive
value.

so we need to have the number which times 4 is equal to unsigned max int + 44:

We found that this is -1073741813.

So lets verify with 'ltrace', we get 44 as a size for memcpy, it works perfectly.
Lets write 'FLOW' to the correct place:

./bonus1 -1073741813 `python -c 'print "FLOW" * 11'`

Finally we have a shell with bonus2
