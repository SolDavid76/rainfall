Starting the executable './level8', we get two '(nil)' so probably the printf of some addresses
then get back the stdin interface.

After some random strings of multiple size, nothing seems to happen so we send the program in gdb.

Inside it, we saw a very long main and no other functions or global variables, but there is a call 'system("/bin/sh")'
so we probably have to give some password to get there.

We also found multiple strings compare after the input request: "auth ", "service", "login", "reset".
We tried then and we managed to get:
- 'auth ' : malloc the first pointer.
- 'service' : malloc the second pointer.
- 'reset' : free the last pointer.
- 'login' : probably the last cmd to get the shell.

Also using multiple 'auth ' or 'service' raises the addresses of the mallocs.
We tried some combinations, and stumbled on a success:  

`auth `
`service`
`service`
`login`

After trying to verify it, we understood that login checks if the 'auth ' address is 32 bits before than the 'service' address.

Finally we have a shell with level9
