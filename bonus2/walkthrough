First of all, we execute the program and we receive 'Hello `arg1`' if we provide 2 arguments but nothing if we provide less or more args

With 'ltrace', we see that the program gets the 'LANG' env variable and that it does exactly the same as we expected with our firsts tests,
except 2 memcmp which are probably where we will find some clues.

In gdb, we found that the memcmp are the 'LANG' being compared to 'fi' (finnish) and 'nl' (dutch).

we tried changing the lang: lANG=nl and we found that we can overflow the buffers with it and rewrite EIP.
(Probably because the greeting is longer in dutch than 'hello ' and the final buffer is 76 chars long)

we have to fill the first strncpy with 40 chars and the second with 23 chars then the 4 next bits will be our address

Lets re-use our shellcode in an env variable and try: 

example:
./bonus2 `python -c 'print "A" * 40'` `python -c 'print "B" * 23 + "\x77\xfe\xff\xbf"'`
