We start the executable but it crashes instantly. After giving an argument it stops crashing.

Opennig the code in gdb, we see that this time, we have no 'gets' or 'printf' to exploit, but we 
have new functions such as 'malloc' and 'strcpy', after some investigations we found that we can exploit
'strcpy' because it is unbounded. 

We also found an unused 'n' function that calls 'system', so we set going inside this function as our goal.

A simple overwrite of the second malloc by overflowing the first one in 'strcpy' calls our function:

./level6 `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"'`

Finally we have a shell with level7
